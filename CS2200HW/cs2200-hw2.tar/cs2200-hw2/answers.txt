Question 1
----------

/* Fix me */
lea $ra, 1
beq $zero, $zero, target
return: 



target: 
/* subroutine would be executed here in the target addres*/
beq $zero, $zero, return



	The return address can be saved using the lea that would take the incremented PC plus the offset of 1 so it would go pass the beq instrustion. However,
since there is now way to jump to an address using a register that contains the address that we would want to jump back to besides the jalr instruction, the 
only option to jump back to the return address would be a create a label after the first beq instruction and then after the target address executes it's instructions
there would then be another beq instruction that would jump back to the return address label.
